# Text-Adventure-Running-on-Sea-s-Edge
A repository containing the product of Section 3 in the "Complete C# Unity Developer 2D: Learn to Code Making Games" course Created by Ben Tristem, GameDev.tv Team, Rick Davidson. Running on Sea's Edge is a text adventure game which practices state management, game design, and story/worldbuilding.


This section of the course covers scriptable objects, text objects, canvas objects, other UI elements, the inspector tool, scenes
and state machines. Running on Sea's Edge is a practice of using state machines to map out an entire text adventure, and using the
tools Unity provides in order to load different scenes dependent on the player choice.
