  storyText: 'Looking back, you seriously wonder why you thought hiding behind bushes
    was a smart idea. One the mages spotted you, only after the rest had passed you.
    It didn''t seem like he recognized a face in the bushes, but he was checking
    nonethless.


    1) Abandon your spot and jump

    2) Keep still. Try to take
    the mage out silently.'
