  storyText: "The bushes seemed the more stupid of the two choices. Entering the
    lighthouse, you realize it might not be as abandoned as you thought. \n\nAn elderly
    man was sitting at the top of the tower. A lightmage given his attire. He was
    peering down at your pursuers when he spotted you haggard and out of breath.\n\n\"Here.\"
    He said without preamble, handing you a glider. \"I know those uniforms and I'd
    do anything to spit in their faces. Take it.\" The man almost seemed too ready
    to help you.\n\n1) Put the glider on.\n2) Refuse.\n\n"
