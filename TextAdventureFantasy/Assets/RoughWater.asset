  storyText: "This was no time to be indecisive. You jump! The cold water engulfed
    you, jolting you to immediate awareness. Years of being in the water have prepared
    you for this eventuality though. You hold your breath and your eyes take in the
    clear blue ocean. \r\nYou could stay under the water and swim to shore, you certainly
    could hold your breath long enough. In fact, you see a path up the side of the
    cliff. Just as you decide to, you see a light underwater. A sub-aquatic cavern
    entrance. You recognize the rock formation, you'd bet money there'd be a pocket
    of air if you dived through.\n\r\n1) Swim to shore. That path might be a way
    behind your pursuers.\r\n2) Dive deep for the cave. Maybe you can wait them out."
