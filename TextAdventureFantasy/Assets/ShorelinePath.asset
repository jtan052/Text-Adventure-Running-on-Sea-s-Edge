  storyText: "The cave looked much too ominous for your tastes. You follow the path
    backward and find a band of sea theives unloading crates and treasure. This must
    be their hideout! \n\nThe lookout perched on their ship's crow's nest shouted
    something and all the theives turned your direction. Before you can react tendrils
    of water restrain you.\n\nThe theives' glinting curved swords matched their smiles.\n\nYou
    lose!\n\n1) Restart"
