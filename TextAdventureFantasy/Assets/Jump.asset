  storyText: 'You only hesitated a second, but you spared no time after that. Ducking
    lower, you scoured the jagged shorline below before finding a riptide calm enough
    to land in. You could only hope it was deep enough.


    Miraculously, you survive
    the fall! Gasping for air, you find youself climbing onto a rock path that could
    only have been placed intentionally.


    1) Follow the path backward. You might
    be able to double back and lose them once and for all.

    2) Enter the cave.
    There might be supplies about, you won''t survive this chase without them.'
