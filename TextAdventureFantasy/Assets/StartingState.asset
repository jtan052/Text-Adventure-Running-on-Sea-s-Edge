  storyText: "You're standing on the edge of a rocky cliff, waves crash against the
    treacherous jagged shoreline below.\r Behind you, your pursuers sling magic and
    arrows and already the ones wielding swords come closer. There's an old lightbridge
    jutting out of the cliff. It doesn't lead anywhere but you might be able to jump
    far enough past the shore to avoid certain death below. \r\n\r\nWhat's your move?\r\n1)
    Take the lightbridge. Running on land won't get you out of this one.\r\n2) Try
    your chances running away at the edge of the cliff. There might be a safer way
    down."
