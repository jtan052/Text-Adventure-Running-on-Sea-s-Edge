  storyText: 'You keep still. The mage approached, dumbly coming close enough for
    you to touch, instead of smoking the bush from a distance. You lunge forward
    just as you see the white of his eyes. You grab him and you can only imagine
    the look of shock as your arm crosses over his throat. He chokes for a moment,
    before biting your arm and forcing both of you off the cliff!


    You weren''t
    so lucky to land in water.


    You lose!


    1) Restart'
