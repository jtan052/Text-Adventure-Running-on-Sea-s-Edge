You're standing on the edge of a rocky cliff, waves crash against the treacherous jagged shoreline below.
Behind you, your pursuers sling magic and arrows and already the ones wielding swords come closer.

What's your move?
1) There's a section of calm water below it's tight but you might make it.
2) Try your chances running away at the edge of the cliff. There might be a safer way down.
