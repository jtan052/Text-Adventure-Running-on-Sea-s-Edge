  storyText: "Turning around, you sprint towards your pursuers and they hesitate
    raising their weapons. That bought you a precious second to aim your leap. You
    jump! Miraculously, you crash through calm water, dodging the jagged rocks and
    crashing waves.\r You climb the closest rock and find a rough path of stones
    that couldn't be anything but placed there intentionally. It led to the mouth
    of a cave, hidden by the perpetual mist of the crashing waves.\r\n\r\n1) Follow
    the path backward, avoiding the cave. There might be a hidden way up the cliff
    and around your pursuers.\r\n2) Enter the cave. It's no fluke it was hidden here.
    You might find supplies, or even a hidden exit to calmer waters."
