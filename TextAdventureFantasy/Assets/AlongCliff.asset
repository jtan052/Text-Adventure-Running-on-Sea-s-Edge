  storyText: "You're not risking it. You run straight for the cliff and your pursuers
    slow down anticipating a suicidal leap of faith but before anyone could react
    you turn at a dime and run alongside the edge. The confusion bought you precious
    seconds.\n\nAn abandoned lighthouse, partially demolished, lay up ahead. Past
    it, the cliff was bare as far as you could see. To your right, you find bushes
    hiding a section carved off the cliff face.\n\n1) Stop at the lighthouse. At
    that height, there might be old magic gliders about. \n2) Step down to the cliff,
    hiding behind the bushes and hope your pursuers try the lighthouse."
