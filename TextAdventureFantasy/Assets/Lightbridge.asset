  storyText: 'The hardlight below your feet has seen better days. It''s nearly fading
    from beneath you. You eat away the distance and suddenly you''re past the shore
    below you. You take a moment to breathe, peering at the rough water below.

    But,
    maybe there was another way? The water was rougher than you expected. You swear
    you saw a calm tidepool deep enough for a jump as you were sprinting earlier.
    If you double back you might make it, it might be safer than the waters below.

    

    1)
    No time, just jump!

    2) Double back and risk the jump closer to the shoreline.'
