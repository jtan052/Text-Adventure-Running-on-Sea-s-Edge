  storyText: 'You pass through mist and moisture and suddenly you find yourself surrounded
    by treasure, clearly stolen goods. This must be sea thieves'' hideout!


    You
    hear clambering and good-natured ribbing through the crashing waves outside -
    another entrance - and spot a small skiff anchored in a large pool leading out
    to calmer waters. Your heart beats, but not with fear, your grin is devilish
    as you gather as much treasure as you can before boarding the skiff and making
    your getaway.


    You win!
